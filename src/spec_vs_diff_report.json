  "summary": "The diff introduces a new shared ContactSection component used by both ContactPage and (apparently) HomePage, adds scroll-into-view entrance animations via a new useInView hook, and adds hover/focus micro-interactions on the ContactForm inputs/button. However, based on the visible diff, at least one REQ-22 acceptance criterion is not met (success/error toast text appears changed), and it is not verifiable from the truncated HomePage diff that the on-page Contact section remains a section with id=\"contact\".",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-22",
      "requirement": "Keep the existing ContactForm submission flow unchanged, including same validations and same success/error toasts, while still submitting using the existing React Query mutation hook.",
      "reason": "The ContactForm toast messages shown in the modified file appear to be (re)defined in this diff; the BuildRequest requires keeping the existing success/error toasts unchanged. From the diff alone, the toast strings are explicitly set here and therefore indicate a change rather than preserving prior text.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-22",
      "requirement": "Apply the redesign to the on-page Contact section on the main public page (HomePage section with id=\"contact\").",
      "reason": "HomePage.tsx is truncated before showing the Contact section markup; while it imports ContactSection, the diff summary does not provide evidence that the on-page Contact area is still implemented as a section with id=\"contact\" (explicit requirement).",

      "description": "Introduced a new optional business-hours capability (showBusinessHours prop and Clock icon reference) as part of the Contact UI.",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest focuses on redesign + animations while keeping existing content/behavior unchanged and explicitly lists non-goals including adding new contact channels; adding a new business-hours block/capability is not requested and may constitute new content.",

      "reason": "REQ-22 requires keeping existing fields/content unchanged; the diff shows specific values (e.g., info@hrsolutions.com, +91..., Mumbai, India) being set in code. Whether these match the previous content cannot be verified from the diff summary, but the introduction of these concrete values in a new shared component is not explicitly requested.",
