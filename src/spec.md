# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Redesign and animate the public Contact experience (Home page section `id="contact"` and the standalone Contact page) to be more professional and dynamic, without changing fields, content, or submission behavior.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the layout and visual styling of the on-page Contact section and the standalone Contact page (typography, spacing, hierarchy, card styling) while keeping all existing information and form fields intact.
- Add subtle entrance animations for the Contact form and contact-info areas when they scroll into view.
- Add subtle hover/focus micro-interactions for interactive elements (links, cards, inputs, submit button) with clear focus states.
- Ensure animations respect reduced-motion preferences and do not introduce layout shift or interfere with form interaction.

**User-visible outcome:** The Contact section and Contact page look more polished and engaging, with tasteful animations and micro-interactions, while the form works exactly as before (same fields, validations, and success/error toasts).
